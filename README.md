- Hidden programs to unlock by being social in meatspace (just ask the authors how!)

## Usage/Examples

### Normal Operation

Insert a CR2032 battery into the holder or plug into a usb-c power supply capable of supplying 5volts. Patterns will start automatically and the device will goto sleep after 10 minutes.
